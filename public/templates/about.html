      "It is a distinct pleasure to recommend Kimberly Giles as a Speaker orTrainer. She recently gave a presentation at Emery County's Benefits Conference. With her zest for life along with her passion to help others our employees where thoroughly entertained as they learned more about themselves and how to better communicate with employees while increasing love and eliminating fear. I, without any reservation, highly recommend Kimberly Giles. She is a tremendous Life Coach with the knowledge and skills to back her up."

        "It was a wonderful presentation that increased my understanding of why I and others behave the way we do. I appreciated that the skills and message were practical and simple because it meant I could put it into practice at that moment (which I ended up needing to do that evening with something I was discussing with my husband).  I feel so much more capable to handle work issues. I really needed this information. Thank you so very much for taking the time to share this information with us!"
